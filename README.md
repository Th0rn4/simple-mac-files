  ## About the App
  
This app was created by me, Reuben Thorn, to solve a personal problem I faced. In university, our lecturer would upload a variety of files, none of them properly named or consistently formatted. To manage this chaos, I developed this app to automatically organize files, storing important ones in appropriate folders and less important ones, usually Excel files in my case, in a separate folder. This makes it easier to discard or manage them without the hassle of searching through disorganized folders.
